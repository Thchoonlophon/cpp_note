## Vector

Analogous to the list in Python. We can get every element of every vector by index, and the index of every element must be integer. And there is one import thing is that we are mustn't use index which is negative number.

If the size of one vector is even, then the vector will assigned to two part. And there is one mid element in each side. just like that picture below.

```mermaid
graph TD

index0[0]-->start0
mid0[mid-1]-->
start0[elements <= median]
mid1[mid]-->
start1[elements >= median]
index1[size-1]-->start1
```

But if it's odd, that will be another story, like this picture below.

```mermaid
graph TD

idx0[0]-->
ele0[elements <= median]
mid0[mid-1]-->ele0
mid1[mid]-->
ele1[median]
mid2[mid+1]-->ele2
idx[size-1]-->
ele2[elements >= median]
```

## Details

- If we define a variable but without an explicit initializer, it means that the value of this variable is undefined.
- We can use `typedef` to rename a type, and that new type which have new name has the same function with the old type.
- The `vector` type is defined in `<vector>` , it's very similar to `list` which is useful type in Python. We can define a  `vector` like `vector<Type> vector_name`, then wen can use the member function of the vector which is defined just now.
  - `vector<T>::size_type `A type guaranteed to be able to hold the number of elements in the largest possible vector .
  - `v.begin()`,`v.end() ` To get the first (last) element of a vector which is name v. 
  - `v.push_back(e)` To append a element which is named e to the last of the vector.
  - `v.size()` To know how many elements in the vector.
  - `v[i]` To get the element whose index is i.
- `sort(b, e) ` Rearranges the elements defined by the range [b, e) into nondecreasing order. Defined in `<algorithm>`. 
- `max(e1, e2)` Returns the larger of the expressions `e1` and `e2`; `e1` and `e2` must have exactly the same type. Defined in `<algorithm>`.
- `while (cin >> x)` Reads a value of an appropriate type into x and tests the state of the stream. If the stream
  is in an error state, the test fails; otherwise, the test succeeds, and the body of the while is executed.
- `s.precision(n)` Sets the precision of stream s to n for future output (or leaves it unchanged if n is omitted). Returns the previous precision.
- `setprecision(n)` Returns a value that, when written on an output stream s, has the effect of calling `s.precision(n)`. Defined in `<iomanip>`. 
- `streamsize` The type of the value expected by `setprecision` and returned by precision. Defined in `<ios>`.
